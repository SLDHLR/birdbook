        <h2>Junglefowl</h2>
        <p>The Sri Lankan Junglefowl (Gallus lafayettii), Sri Lanka’s national bird, is a striking species native to
            the
            island's lowland forests and scrublands. Males are known for their vivid coloration, featuring a bright red
            comb, a fiery orange neck, and a deep purple tail, while females have more subdued brownish plumage,
            providing excellent camouflage. These birds are ground dwellers, foraging for seeds, grains, fruits, and
            insects in small groups or solitary pairs. Their loud, distinctive crowing is most often heard at dawn and
            dusk. During the breeding season, which typically occurs between February and May, males engage in
            territorial battles and perform elaborate courtship displays to attract females. After mating, females lay
            2-4 eggs in well-hidden ground nests and take full responsibility for incubating and raising the chicks.
            Although the Sri Lankan Junglefowl is not endangered, deforestation and habitat loss pose long-term threats.
            This bird holds cultural significance in Sri Lanka and is closely related to the domestic chicken, providing
            insight into avian evolution. As a symbol of the country's rich biodiversity, the Junglefowl is celebrated
            in local traditions and artwork.<br><br><br>

        <h2>Layard's Parakeet</h2>
        <p>Layard's Parakeet (Psittacula calthropae), also known as the Sri Lankan Hanging Parrot, is a vibrant bird
            species endemic to the forests of Sri Lanka. Named after the British naturalist Edgar Leopold Layard, this
            parakeet is medium-sized, with a distinctive green plumage and a bluish-gray head. Males have a red patch on
            the shoulder and red upper mandibles, while females have a more subtle coloring. These social birds are
            often seen in flocks, flying rapidly through forest canopies or perching on treetops. They feed primarily on
            fruits, seeds, buds, and nectar, playing a vital role in forest ecosystems as seed dispersers. Layard’s
            Parakeets nest in tree cavities, where the female lays around 3-4 eggs. Both parents participate in raising
            the chicks. Though their population is stable, deforestation and habitat fragmentation pose significant
            threats to this species in the long term. These parakeets are beloved for their lively, chattering calls and
            playfulness, making them a cherished sight in Sri Lanka’s wilderness.<br><br><br>
